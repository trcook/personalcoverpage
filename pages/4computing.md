Outside of purely academic research, I am fascinated with technology and the potential for modern computing horsepower to change the way we  collect, manage and analyze data. Over the past several years, I have become increasingly familiar with R, Python, LaTeX and Ruby. I have also recently begun using cloud-based server clusters to run complex modeling tasks and matching algorithms. 

My [Gist](http://gist.github.com/trcook) and [Github](http://www.github.com/trcook)  contain projects and code samples that I have developed for fun or which have otherwise emerged from my academic pursuits. A few of these are worthy of specific mention here: 

* [NCAA Kaggle Competition 2015 (with Stefan Wojcik and Joby Schaffer)](https://github.com/trcook/badaboost_ncaa_kaggle_2015)
* [TFI Kaggle Competition 2015 (with Stefan Wojcik)](https://github.com/trcook/TFI)
* [Getting Up and Running with StarCluster on AWS](https://github.com/trcook/starcluster_example)
* [A framework for scraping WTO dispute data](https://github.com/trcook/wto_python_scrape)
* [An adaptation of the WTO framework to collect data for NCAA rankings](https://github.com/trcook/ncaa_tournament_scrape)
* [The tmisc package -- a collection of useful functions in R](https://github.com/trcook/tmisc)
