## Dissertation

My dissertation is an examination of reputation mechanisms and their role in international relations. Specifically, it explores the extent to which membership in an untested agreement influences a state's reputation. 

International actors face a dilemma. While agreements with other states can yield substantial benefits, actors are often left uncertain as to whether their potential partners will ultimately follow-through or renege on their commitment to an alliance (c.f. Smith 1995, Leeds Long and Mitchell 2000). Scholars have argued that actors attempt to reduce this uncertainty by assessing their partner's reputation (see Crescenzi et al. 2012, Gibler 2008, Tomz 2007). Broadly, scholars have characterized a state's reputation with an international actor as as the outcome of a specific sequence of events wherein the state (1) joins an international agreement (2) demonstrates compliance or non-compliance with it's obligations under the agreement (3) is observed demonstrating compliance/non-compliance by the potential ally and (4) comes to have a reputation for reliability with that potential ally. 

But what happens when step 2 never occurs? This might occur, for example, if a state is in a collective security agreement that effectively deters aggression (c.f. Leeds 2003): without the occurrence of conflict, a state has few opportunities to demonstrate its commitment to the agreement. Extant models of reputation assessment typically ignore (or omit) membership in these agreements (which I call, simply, untested agreements, or untested alliances) when calculating reputation. Combined with the use of a decay term, membership in an untested agreement produces a negative effect on reputation in these models. 

Contrary to extant models, I argue that membership in untested agreements is actually *beneficial* to a state's reputation. Broadly, the benefit of membership in an untested agreement comes from the signal provided by the state's entry into the agreement. When a state enters an agreement, the other members of that agreement implicitly endorse the reliability and/or trustworthiness of the state. I call this entry-endorsement. 

The benefit conferred by entry endorsement is conditioned on a variety of factors. Similar to recent scholarly work in this area (see Gray and Hicks 2014;Gray 2013) I argue that characteristics of the endorser influence the reputational benefit felt by the state. Specifically, I suggest that the nature of the relationship between the endorser and subsequent international actors (i.e. reputation assessors such as investors or potential allies) moderates the influence of entry endorsement. I also consider the role played by the reputation assessor's recent history. I argue that, when an international actor has been betrayed in previous international agreements, it is less likely to look favorably upon entry endorsement as an indicator of a state's reliability of trustworthiness. 

I test the implications of this argument as they apply to two distinct issue areas: international investment and security agreements. Through this, I am able to compare how entry endorsement's effects differ depending on the relationship between the endorser and subsequent state actors (potential investors and allies respectively). When the subsequent international actor is another state (i.e. potential ally), then the influence of entry endorsement is substantial, but moderated  by the similarity between the actor and the endorser. On the other hand, when the subsequent international actor is a sub-state actor (i.e. a potential investor), then the influence of entry endorsement is comparatively stronger and is conditioned by the endorsing state's political vulnerability to making a bad endorsement (i.e. entering an agreement with a state that later reneges on the agreement).


## Additional Research Interests

In the broadest sense, my research interests are centered on the role of time and information transmission in international cooperation. Some of the (big picture) questions that interest me are: 

* How do states convincingly transmit information given potentially strong incentives
to be dishonest?
* How do international actors determine the quality their potential cooperation partners?
* Why do negotiations take a long time to settle?
* What determines the length of time that a state will wait before acceding to an
international agreement?

My research interests focus primarily on the intersection between comparative
and international political economy. Centrally, I am interested in property
rights and the domestic and international forces that lead to the creation of
property rights. A guiding theme in my research are the questions, "how does
the state know when and to what extent it should change its property rights
regime?" and "what determines the strength of property rights?" In response
to the latter, my research suggests that the conventional wisdom (that
democracies have stronger property rights than non-democracies) is accurate, but
only to a point; the strength of property rights is also contingent upon the
mobility of the property in question and the availability of alternative sources
for property rights. With regard to the former, I find that states change
property rights in response to several types of signal: public demand (voice),
capital flight (exit), and international pressure.
