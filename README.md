# Project
Personal One-page website with deployment scripts


# Description
This is my personal website. I built it using a combination of code from [jekyll-boostrap ](https://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap) and (singlepaged)[http://t413.com/SinglePaged]

I added some customizations to the rakefile and general structure so that, when configured properly, rake will generate and serve a local preview or push a generated version to my public-facing web-server.

I also changed a number of aspects of the layout from singlepaged so that they suit my aesthetic prefrences. 

You can see the site in action at [thomasrcook.com](http://www.thomasrcook.com)

It's not my intention that anyone would use this as a template for their site. I post it here for my own personal backup purposes and to allow others to see how I've coded things (if they're interested).
